By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these
terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed
Work available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights may be labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     view of rights holders who are not Authorized to circumvent
     Effective Technological Measures, are designed to, are reasonably
     effective expecting normal use, manage access to the Licensed
     Material, and either prevent or restrict acts not authorized by this
     Public License.

  d. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  e. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  f. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  g. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  h. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  i. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  j. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technological measures. The Licensed
          Rights include the right to use the Licensed Material in all
          ways, including in all media and formats whether now known or
          hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
          necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any right or authority to forbid You from making
          technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, including technological measures that are designed to
          circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of
          this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by
          this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, such as a copyright notice,
                    license notice, notice to a patent claim, or
                    other reasonable manner of attribution as
                    requested by the Licensor, and in the manner
                    reasonably practicable;

                 ii. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                     extent reasonably practicable;

            B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications;

            C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License or a human-readable
               summary of the terms and conditions for this Public
               License in a manner that reasonably communicates the
               absence of any warranty; and

            D. if requested by the Licensor, remove any of the
               information or elements specified in Section 3(a)(1)(A)
               at the Licensor's sole discretion.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, or context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          attribution elements specified by the Licensor in Section
          3(a)(1)(A) at the Licensor's sole discretion.

  b. ShareAlike.

       In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
       Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also
       apply.

       1. The Adapted Material You distribute must be licensed under
          this Public License or a License Compatible with this Public
          License.

       2. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You
          Share Adapted Material.

       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
          Measures to, the Adapted Material that restrict exercise of
          the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Adapted Material.

  c. Required notice.

       If You Share the Licensed Material or any Adapted Material, You
       must include a copy of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
       License with the material. You may satisfy this condition in any
       reasonable manner based on the medium, means, or context in which
       You Share the Licensed Material. If requested by the Licensor,
       You must remove any of the attribution elements specified by the
       Licensor in Section 3(a)(1)(A) at the Licensor's sole discretion.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor offers the Licensed
Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether
express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not
known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed
by law, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

To the extent possible, effective immediately upon commencement of
Your use of the Licensed Material, the Licensor waives any claims or
assertions of moral rights or moral rights (including, without
limitation, rights of paternity, publication, reputation, and/or
disclosure) by You related to the Licensed Material.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the full term of the Copyright
     and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply
     with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public
     License terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured after
          You have received notice of the violation from the Licensor;
          or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
       right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
       of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.

Section 7 – Trademarks, jurisdictional restrictions, and disclaimers of
warranties.

a. Trademarks.

   This Public License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
   trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor or any other rights
   holder except as required to comply with Section 3(a) of this Public
   License.

   b. Patents.

   This Public License does not grant any rights with respect to any
   patents, patent claims, or patent applications, whether domestic or
   foreign, or any other patent rights that Licensor may have.

   c. Jurisdictional restrictions.

   The disclaimers of warranties and limitations of liability provided
   above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the maximum extent
   permitted by applicable law, gives the Licensor the maximum protection
   permitted under applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, the
   Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted to You by this
   Public License.

Section 8 – Limitation on Liability.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, and as between You and the
Licensor (and not any other beneficiary of these terms and conditions),
in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory
(including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct,
special, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses,
costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of
the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a
limitation of liability is not allowed by law, in lieu of such
limitation, the Licensor limits its liabilities to the extent permitted
by law.

Section 9 – Miscellaneous.

  a. No waiver. No term or condition of this Public License will be
     waived and no failure to comply with its terms or conditions will
     be deemed a waiver of them or of the right to enforce them.

  b. Severability. If any provision of this Public License is invalid
     or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
     validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Public
     License.

  c. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
     be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
     Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or
     sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor
     or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
     3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  d. Assignment. You may not assign or transfer any of Your rights or
     obligations under this Public License without the prior written
     consent of the Licensor.

  e. No third-party beneficiaries. This Public License does not create
     any third-party beneficiary rights in any individual or entity.

  f. No circumvention of disclaimers. The limitations on remedies and
     liability in Sections 5 and 8 apply to the maximum extent permitted
     by applicable law. You may not attempt to circumvent these
     limitations in any way, including by asserting claims against any
     Licensor party other than the Licensor itself for claims arising
     from the Licensed Material.
